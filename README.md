# Sum All Prime Numbers
Algorithm Challenge in Javascript

A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 with exactly two divisors: 1 and itself. For example, 2 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 2. In contrast, 4 is not prime since it is divisible by 1, 2 and 4.

This algorithm challenge involves creating a function that returns the sum of all prime numbers that are less than or equal to a given number. For example, if the function receives 10 as an argument, it should return 17 (sum of prime numbers 2+3+5+7 = 17).
